  - Settings persistence and loading

#### World Generator System (scripts/world/world_generator.gd)
- **Advanced Procedural Generation**: Comprehensive world generation with multiple biomes and features
- **Key Features**:
  - 7 biome types (ocean, beach, plains, forest, desert, mountains, snow)
  - Multi-layered noise generation (height, temperature, moisture, detail, caves, structures)
  - Advanced chunk management with object pooling for performance
  - Threaded world generation with progress tracking
  - Structure and resource generation based on biome and height
  - Climate system with temperature and moisture mapping
  - Performance optimization with render distance and chunk limits
  - Comprehensive world data tracking and statistics

#### Combat Manager System (scripts/combat/combat_manager.gd)
- **Sophisticated Combat System**: Advanced turn-based combat with modern mechanics
- **Key Features**:
  - 6 combat states with pause functionality
  - 4 combat phases (INITIATIVE, PLANNING, EXECUTION, RESOLUTION)
  - 6 action types (ATTACK, SKILL, ITEM, DEFEND, FLEE, SPECIAL)
  - Advanced damage calculation with critical hits and status effects
  - AI combatant management with automated actions
  - Combat environment system (terrain, weather, time effects)
  - Status effect tracking and management
  - Combat history and performance tracking
  - Flee mechanics with chance calculation
  - Turn timeout and auto-defend systems

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Modern Godot 4.x Patterns
- **Type Annotations**: All functions use proper return types and parameter types
- **Class Names**: Implemented class_name for all major systems
- **Export Groups**: Organized exports with @export_group for better editor organization
- **Signal-Driven Architecture**: Comprehensive signal system for loose coupling
- **State Machines**: Implemented in UI, combat, and player systems
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular architecture for extensibility

### Performance Optimization
- **Object Pooling**: Implemented in world generation for chunk management
- **Threaded Operations**: World generation runs in separate threads
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Proper use of typed arrays and dictionaries
- **Update Intervals**: Configurable update rates for performance tuning
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management

### Documentation Standards
- **Quantum-Level Detail**: Comprehensive inline documentation for all systems
- **Cross-Referencing**: Systems reference each other appropriately
- **Real-Time Updates**: Documentation updated as code changes
- **Context-Aware Explanations**: Clear descriptions of system interactions

## System Integration Patterns

### Signal Connections
- **GameManager Integration**: All systems connect to GameManager for state changes
- **InputManager Integration**: UI and combat systems respond to input actions
- **SaveSystem Integration**: Settings and data persistence across systems
- **AudioManager Integration**: Sound effects and music management

### Data Flow
- **State Propagation**: Game state changes propagate to all systems
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Systems respond to events rather than polling
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation before action execution
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states and recovery mechanisms

## Next Development Priorities

### Phase 3: Gameplay Systems
- **Inventory System**: Advanced item management with categories and filtering
- **Crafting System**: Recipe-based crafting with material requirements
- **Quest System**: Dynamic quest generation and tracking
- **NPC System**: Advanced NPC behavior and interaction
- **Economy System**: Trading and currency management

### Phase 4: Content and Polish
- **Asset Integration**: Sprite, sound, and model integration
- **UI Polish**: Beautiful and responsive user interface
- **Game Balance**: Tuning combat, progression, and economy
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing and bug fixing

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- **Multiplayer**: Network synchronization and multiplayer support
- **Modding**: Mod support and content creation tools
- **Advanced AI**: Sophisticated enemy AI and pathfinding
- **Procedural Content**: Advanced procedural generation algorithms
