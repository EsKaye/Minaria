# 🏛️ Minaria Architecture Documentation

## 📋 System Overview
Minaria is built on a modular architecture that separates concerns while maintaining clear communication between systems. The game uses Godot's node-based architecture with custom systems for world generation, crafting, and combat.

## 🧩 Core Systems

### 1. World Generation System
- **Terrain Generation**
  - Procedural height map generation
  - Biome-specific terrain features
  - Layer-based world structure
  - Dynamic chunk loading/unloading

- **Biome System**
  - Biome-specific rules and parameters
  - Weather and environmental effects
  - Flora and fauna generation
  - Resource distribution

### 2. Crafting System
- **Item Management**
  - Item database and properties
  - Recipe system
  - Resource tracking
  - Inventory management

- **Crafting Interface**
  - UI components for crafting
  - Recipe visualization
  - Resource requirements display
  - Crafting animations

### 3. Combat System
- **Player Combat**
  - Attack mechanics
  - Defense systems
  - Special abilities
  - Equipment effects

- **Enemy AI**
  - Behavior trees
  - State machines
  - Pathfinding
  - Combat tactics

### 4. UI System
- **HUD Components**
  - Health and resource displays
  - Minimap
  - Inventory interface
  - Quest tracking

- **Menu System**
  - Main menu
  - Settings
  - Inventory
  - Crafting interface

## 🔄 System Interactions

### World ↔ Crafting
- Resource gathering affects world state
- Crafting stations placed in world
- Environmental effects on crafting

### Combat ↔ World
- Terrain affects combat mechanics
- Environmental hazards
- Dynamic combat arenas

### UI ↔ All Systems
- Real-time feedback
- System state visualization
- User input handling

## 📦 Data Flow

### Input Processing
1. User input captured
2. Input validated
3. Action dispatched to appropriate system
4. System processes action
5. UI updates to reflect changes

### World Updates
1. Player movement triggers chunk loading
2. Biome systems update based on player position
3. Environmental effects applied
4. UI reflects current state

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- Save file validation
- Input sanitization
- Anti-cheat measures
- Data integrity checks

## ⚡ Performance Optimization
- Chunk-based world loading
- Object pooling for frequently spawned objects
- Efficient pathfinding algorithms
- Texture atlasing for sprites

## 🎨 Rendering Pipeline
- Custom shaders for visual effects
- Dynamic lighting system
- Particle effects
- Post-processing effects

## 📊 Data Structures
- Quad-tree for spatial partitioning
- Binary heaps for pathfinding
- Hash maps for quick lookups
- Custom data structures for world chunks

## 🔄 Update Cycle
1. Input processing
2. Physics simulation
3. Game logic update
4. Animation update
5. Rendering
6. UI update

## 🛠️ Development Tools
- Custom level editor
- Biome editor
- Item editor
- Animation editor

## 📈 Scalability
- Modular design allows for easy expansion
- Plugin system for new features
- Configurable systems
- Extensible architecture
